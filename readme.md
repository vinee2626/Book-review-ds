# Book Reviews Data analysis using Pandas

## Data-set available at -> https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset?select=Books+Data+with+Category+Language+and+Summary 

This project consists of a book review data- set. And I have performed several operations over this dataset regarding the book ratings, author,publisher and ratings. 
I have used methods from pandas and matplotlib libraries.

# In the data exploration part I tried to solve the following questions and gain some insights from that:

- Which author has published most of the books?
- In which year the maximum number of books were in demand?  
- How many year old books have the best ratings? 
- Books in what language are most preffered? And in which country? 
- Which genre of book should be advertised the most?
- Which publishers are most successfull? 

# To solve these question, I used plotting, matplotlib and pandas methods. The steps that I followed to solve these questions are as mentioned:

- Importing the libraries required for the project.
- Read the data from csv file to create a new DataFrame.
- Cleaned the data-set by dropping out the Nan/Null values and also removed any Unnamed column.
- Visualized the data by using plot and matplotlib functions.
- Used groupby to perform aggregate analysis.
- Used scatter graphs to describe the data precisely.
- Used pandas funtions such as astype and to_numeric to format the column element.
- Used loc funtions to perform conditional operation.
